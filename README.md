# Abstractive Text Summarization using Deep Learning
In this project, the [Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews) dataset is used. Data cleaning and pre-processing has been carried out using standard NLP techniques. A seq2seq model with an attentive encoder-decoder architecture was used for text summarization.
